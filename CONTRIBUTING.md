# Contributing to HALO-DROPS

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to HALO-DROPS, and I am hoping that you didn't land here by mistake. But even if you did, now that you are here, why not help us out a bit with this package? There are [different ways](#how-can-you-help-us) in which you can contribute to HALO-DROPS. To know how to get started, jump to [Development Workflow](#development-workflow).

## How can you help us?

You can help us by:

- Submitting issues 
  - Tell us about any bugs you encounter, enhancements or features that you think the package should include, or even things like some missing documentation that might be useful to you and others. Simply raise an [issue](https://github.com/Geet-George/halodrops/issues)! Even if you are not sure if something qualifies as an issue, just raise an issue anyway. You might end up getting the solution or you might help out someone else facing the same problem, it's a win-win. :)
- Documenting 
  - A large and very important part of HALO-DROPS is the documentation that goes with it. This includes the protocols for operations and data processing as well as the explanations behind them. We also need how-to guides to explain better how the package can be employed. And there are functions and classes that can benefit from better docstrings. There is almost never enough documentation. In fact, this very document `CONTRIBUTING.md` needs more documentation. So, pick out a small aspect and try your hand at it. The universe will thank you.
- Coding
  - Scripts and classes and methods... A lot remains to be done in the package. 

Have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/Geet-George/halodrops/issues) and you will find the places that HALO-DROPS needs help with! Pick an issue and assign it to yourself, so others know that you are working on that. If you are not sure how to proceed, you can express your interest by commenting on the issue, and someone should help you out.

## Development Workflow

- Create environment from `environment.yml`
- Install `halodrops`
