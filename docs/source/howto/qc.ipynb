The temperature sensor in the RD-41 sonde has a sampling frequency of 2 Hz, whereas the GPS sensor (from where the horizontal winds are derived) has a sampling frequency of 4 Hz. The time-coordinates are the same for both variables and are spaced every 0.25 seconds, which aligns exactly with the GPS sensor frequency. Therefore, it is a bit unfair to compare the fraction of temperature values against all time coordinates, given that it is not supposed to be measuring so frequently. A better way would be to compare the profile-coverage weighted for the sampling frequency. \n",

This is exactly what the [weighted_fullness](../apidocs/halodrops/halodrops.qc.profile.md#halodrops.qc.profile.weighted_fullness) function does."
