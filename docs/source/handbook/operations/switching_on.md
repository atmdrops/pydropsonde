2. Power on HRDS components in the `Switch rack` with switches `SW1`, `SW2`, `SW3`, `SW4` and `SW5` (in that order). Photo below shows all switches in the `on` position. The breakers (marked as `CB`) in both racks are not to be touched - they should be kept in their original positione, i.e. pressed in.
