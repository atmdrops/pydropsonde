# Handbook

This handbook documents the procedures to be followed for {doc}`operations <operations/index>` of dropsondes on the HALO aircraft, as well as for {doc}`data-handling <data/index>`. It serves as a sequence of steps (in some cases, a checklist) that have to be followed for the aforementioned purposes. The handbook is minimal in terms of explaining the rationale behind the procedures. You will likely find these in the {doc}`Explanations <explanation/index>` section.
