# Installation

For now, halodrops is not a `pip` or `conda` package.
You can either clone the repository by

```
git clone git@github.com:Geet-George/halodrops.git
```

and create a respective python environment with `conda` from the base folder directory:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will install halodrops in development mode.

Alternatively, you can directly install the package from github using pip

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Geet-George/halodrops.git#egg=halodrops
```
